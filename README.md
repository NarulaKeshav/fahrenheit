# Fahrenheit

Fahrenheit is a weather application that allows you to view the weather of your current city in both metric and imperial system, along with 4-day forecast. Along with that, you can view the weather in a different location and its 4-day forecast. This project was inspired by [FreeCodeCamp](http://freecodecamp.com)
